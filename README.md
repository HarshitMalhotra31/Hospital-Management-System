# Hospital-Management-System
Hospital Management System is a modular, menu-driven software project developed in C programming language to automate vital hospital tasks. It is designed to substitute time-consuming paper-based or spreadsheet practices with a light, organized, and automated alternative for small and medium-sized healthcare organizations. The system automates major activities like patient registration, doctor data, appointment schedules, billing, and emergency cases utilizing basic data structures such as linked lists and priority queues. It enables adding, searching, updating, and deleting records in an efficient manner, providing correct storage of data with file handling for permanent records. Priority is automatically given to emergency cases, avoiding time wastage during crucial care. Charges for physician fees, room rent, drugs, and tests are calculated by the billing module with minimal user effort. With a plain text-based interface, the system is user-friendly even for non-specialist staff. This project illustrates how data structures and C can be used to address real-life administrative problems, making hospitals more efficient, minimizing errors, and maximizing the outcomes of patient care.
